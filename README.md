# 6-Degree-of-Freedom-Parallel-Cartesian-Manipulator
This project implements a control system for a 6-DOF Cartesian Parallel Manipulator, developed using Visual Studioâ€™s SDI interface and driven by Maxon EPOS controllers with DC motors. The system is designed for high-precision automation tasks such as nut and bolt handling and operates over a 2D grid from 1A to 37X.
